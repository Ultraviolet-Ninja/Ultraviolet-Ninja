## Introduction

Who am I? Call me Jasmine or Jazz or J. I'm an educator, mentor, and self-proclaimed **Java-neer** (*which means I probably belong in Arkham Asylum*). When it comes to computers, I like 3 things; I like Quantum Computers, I really like solving problems and I love Java.

To me, programming is this great 3-way mix between playing chess, fixing cars and solving murder cases; you write a way to solve a problem while considering others, but if something goes wrong, then you have to spend time learning what killed the program and what was the murder weapon. This is where I thrive.





## The Way of the Jragon - My Philosophy

There are 3 parts to anything I do to make software projects: Desire, Theory, and Application.

- **Desire** - If there's a project that I can apply to a problem in my life, then that's strong motivation to open up the notebook and start writing.

- **Theory** - Computer Science has a lot of complex parts to it. What's a `HashMap`? How does a search engine work? What the hell does `static` mean? Why is `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` **false**? Being able to look past the abstractions and understand the underlying concepts is something I very much enjoy.

- **Application** - What do Hiccup of Berk, [Michael Reeves](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelReeves), and [The Hacksmith](https://www.youtube.com/@hacksmith) have in common? They identified an issue, made a solution and iterated on their design. You can see their processes too, and that's important. The way I go about coding is to start with a stupid question. I ask [a lot of them](https://github.com/Ultraviolet-Ninja/Stupid-Questions), usually from either of the 2 preceding parts. Then, we do research, design, prototype, outline steps and make changes.
